## New Ban System 
We are adapting ban systems from **ERM** and a trial **Loser's Ban** which favors low ranked teams from the point leaderboard.

### Match 1 
NO BAN

### Match i+1
- **ERM Adaptation:** Characters that were picked by two or more players in the previous round will be banned in the current round.
- **Loser's Ban:** Bottom 4 teams of the point leaderboard will each have a turn of 30 seconds to ban one character, starting from the highest to lowest ranked team (5 to 8).
