## Player Broadcast Guidelines

Players are allowed to stream the tournament from their own perspective but must match the delay (1 minute delay). Players streaming with less delay will be asked to increase their delay for the sake of all other participants in their group. Failure to do so will be met with heavy consequences. 

## Third-Party Tools

If the organizers recommend the players to use specific third-party tools (Discord, etc) the players should follow the organizers’ decision. All entrants of this Tournament must join the Lyfin Discord Server in order to receive news and communicate with the tournament staff.

The player must own a Steam account to participate in the tournament. If the associated Eternal Return account is currently or has been previously banned By Nimble Neuron, the player will not be allowed to play in the tournament. The duration of tournament suspensions will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Using an alternate account to try and circumvent a ban will result in immediate disqualification. Teammates of a banned player will also be punished for helping to circumvent a ban. Account sharing is not allowed. Players may not play on another user’s account under any circumstances. All disputes over account ownership will be investigated and handled by the organizers.

Players may not drop from an on-going set of games due to poor performance. Players should also follow the tournament staffs’ instructions and accept any final decisions made by referees or organizers. Treat all fellow players and tournament staff with respect.

## Rehost

Failure to start a match caused by server problems, natural disasters, or specific technical problems can result in a rehost of the lobby. If the game is to be rehosted, all players MUST maintain the same character picks + Main Augment. Rehosts will also sometimes occur in the case of player disconnections, according to section [Disconnect during Online Match.] [Failure to do so will be subjected to -2 points for each rule broken]

> **Example**: “Player A” retains the same character pick but fails to pick the same previously selected “Main Augment”, therefore -2 points will be deducted. If both options are picked wrongly, -4 points will be deducted.

## Disconnect during In Game

Unintentional disconnects or crashes occurring during the loading screen or within the first 30 seconds of game start may result in a rehost. For player-side issues, “up to 1 lobby rehosts per team can be offered as a courtesy”. If any member of the team cannot play the game normally after that, the match will proceed normally. Make sure you put the game to “SSD drive” to smoothen the whole tournament.
